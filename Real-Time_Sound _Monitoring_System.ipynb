    "## Real-Time Sound Monitoring System\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a **real-time sound level monitoring system** using Python. It captures audio from the microphone and computes the **sound pressure level** (SPL) in decibels (dB). The system categorizes the sound level into three distinct thresholds:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Safe**: Sound levels below 70 dB, which are considered safe for prolonged exposure.\n",
    "- **Moderate**: Sound levels between 70 and 85 dB, indicating moderate sound levels that may require caution.\n",
    "- **Dangerous**: Sound levels above 85 dB, where exposure may be harmful over extended periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The system works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Audio Capture**: The microphone stream is captured in real-time using the `sounddevice` library.\n",
    "2. **Audio Processing**: The captured audio chunks are processed to calculate the **Root Mean Square (RMS)**, which is then converted into decibels (dB).\n",
    "3. **Sound Level Categorization**: The calculated decibel levels are categorized into different sound level ranges.\n",
    "4. **Output**: The decibel level and its corresponding status are printed in real-time every second, along with warnings if the sound level exceeds defined thresholds.\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation runs for a duration of **1 minute** and continuously monitors the sound levels during that period.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Parameters:\n",
    "- **Sampling Rate**: 44100 Hz (standard for high-quality audio)\n",
    "- **Threshold Levels**: \n",
    "    - Safe: Below 70 dB\n",
    "    - Moderate: 70â€“85 dB\n",
    "    - Dangerous: Above 85 dB\n",
    "- **Monitoring Duration**: 60 seconds (1 minute)\n",
    "\n",
    "This system can be useful for monitoring sound environments in real-time, ensuring user safety, and providing warnings for potentially harmful exposure to high sound levels.\n"
